# nvim-jumpstart-kit
A predefined neovim configuration set for lazy people ;)

## Disclaimer
I do not own any of included vim plugins, and this jumpstart kit is based on [craftzdog](https://github.com/craftzdog)'s work, only differs in 
some recent version plugin workarounds which are introduced in this kit.
